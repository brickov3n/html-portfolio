        <h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>Dragon Ball GT</h3>
        <p>This is not exactly a movie. It's an anime that I have been watching since I was a teenager.
            I love to watch it because of the story line and the fighting.
        </p>    
        <h3>The Note Book</h3>
        <p>This movie made me cry. It has such a romantic love story.</p>
        <h3>Star Wars</h3>
        <p>This movie by far is one of my favorite. what I love about it is the story line seems to never end,
            there is always something new to learn, just when you thougt you knew everything.
